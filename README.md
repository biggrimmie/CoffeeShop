## CoffeeShop
A simple program used to input and calculate a local coffee shops sales

I wrote this program in about a day for a project for Computer Science 2 at school. I used Java and JavaFX for the entirety of it as that was our main focus.

# INSTALL
Simply download the files into a single folder and run it in your code editor.

# USE
Input the number of the coffee cups you purchased in the month, as well as select the numbers of cups you purchased on Wednesdays between 2 and 4 PM and hit calculate.

# FILES
* JanduraLab13 - The main file of the program, creates the gui and handles the main logic
* JanduraPointsEarnedD - Class file that keeps track of the users loyalty points
* JanduraBonusPoints - Calculates the bonus points earned based on volume of coffee
* JanduraWednesdayPoints - Calculates the bonus points earned specifically on Wednesday between 2 and 4 PM
